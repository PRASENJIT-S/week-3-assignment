     <h2>ABOUT</h2>
     <p>PW Skills is an online resource that provides coding training and makes the claim that it may help students find employment.
         It's crucial to remember that while learning code from PW Skills undoubtedly improve your knowledge and programming skills,
          the promise of landing a job purely based on finishing a coding school is unrealistic.</p>
